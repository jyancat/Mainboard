## Instructions

To fit typical home 3D printers, the case is split into five sections.  Each section is printable without supports.

The left and right sections of both the bottom and top covers are available in both "cut" and "full" versions.  The cut version allows for oversized Expansion Cards, while the full version fully encloses the Expansion Cards.

1. bottom_cover_l - This is the part the Audio Board can optionally go into.  Available in cut and full versions, and available using either fasteners or press fit pins to hold the Mainboard.
2. bottom_cover_r - This is the part the WiFi module can optionally go into.  Available in cut and full versions, and available using either fasteners or press fit pins to hold the Mainboard.  You can also install U.FL to SMA antenna adapters to enable easy antenna use (for example: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088GRM7SG).
3. top_cover_l - Available in cut and full versions.
4. top_cover_r - Available in cut and full versions, and default and Framework logo power button styles.
5. top_cover_main
6. connect_pin - You'll need to print 10 of these to attach the top and bottom covers.
7. mainboard_pin - If you printed the pin versions of the bottom cover parts, you can use this pin to hold the Mainboard in.

Note that you'll need some fasteners to install everything (see https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Fasteners+Guide/106 for all fastener types)

1. 5x Mainboard fasteners (if you didn't print the _pin version of the bottom cover) - M1.6 1.5mm fastener with a 5.5mm diameter T5 head
2. 3x Audio Board and WiFi card fasteners - M2 3.0mm fastener with a 4.5mm diameter T5 head
